# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I've spent my career creating experiences for new technologies that drive R&D and garner investment and interest. Now I am pivoting my skills toward space science. To know about the universe is to know about ourselves. I am passionate about making experiences that connect with the hearts and minds of the public, and help the scientific community find new insights by interpreting data in new ways.

You can learn more about my career up to this point by going to [charleneatlas.com](http://www.charleneatlas.com).
